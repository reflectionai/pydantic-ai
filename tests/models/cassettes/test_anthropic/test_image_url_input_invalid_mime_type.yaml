      - text: This is a Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus), a large and powerful owl species native to the Americas. The
          image shows the owl perched on a log or branch, surrounded by soft yellow and green vegetation. The owl has distinctive
          ear tufts (the "horns"), large yellow eyes, and a mottled gray-brown plumage that provides excellent camouflage
          in woodland and grassland environments. Great Horned Owls are known for their impressive size, sharp talons, and
          nocturnal hunting habits. They are formidable predators that can hunt animals as large as skunks, rabbits, and even
          other birds of prey.
