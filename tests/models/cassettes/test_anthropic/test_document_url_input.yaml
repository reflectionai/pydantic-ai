      content:
      - text: This document appears to be a sample PDF file that mainly contains Lorem ipsum text, which is placeholder text
          commonly used in design and publishing. The document starts with "Sample PDF" as its title, followed by the line
          "This is a simple PDF file. Fun fun fun." The rest of the content consists of several paragraphs of Lorem ipsum
          text, which is Latin-looking but essentially meaningless text used to demonstrate the visual form of a document
          without the distraction of meaningful content.
