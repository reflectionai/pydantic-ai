              That's a classic! It's famously known as a **pangram**, which means it's a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet.

              It's often used for:
              *   **Typing practice:** To ensure all keys are hit.
              *   **Displaying font samples:** Because it showcases every character.

              Just a small note, it's typically written as "lazy dog" (two words) and usually ends with a period:

              **The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.**
